* a better-illustrated xkcd? Something beautifully arty for geeks

* distill the stories for picture books

Stawry

Guy at work; depressed; tries to reach out to someone, but gets rejected; takes bus to local pub to wallow; starts drawing; amazing things happen

This story has the potential to become something really crazy, because the illustrator's imagination starts running wild while he is in the pub.

Stories within the story
He can meet all sorts of characters on his way.
Every character can be a story within the story, even if only as one sketch.
E.g. "The willow that wallowed" -- before: huge green willow tree; after: huge brown golem-like creature as the tree has just wallowed in brown mud.

Mixing media
At some point the protagonist can draw a map on his hand and here we can incorporate a photo of my actual hand with a map drawn on it. So, photos and sketches!


Less is more

Appealing to old and young alike.

The "more" could be subdued yet still provide entertainment to those who seek it.

E.g. "less" could be coloured and entertaining to children, and "more" can be grayscale, in the shadows, and entertaining to adults.


Counterpoint

words and images have different meanings.

How to achieve counterpoint in a graphic-only book?

Page turner

Recto
Verso
Introducing new information on the right to urge the turn of the page

Spanning books

Spanning young and adult books

E.g. The Handsome Foot could be a cleanly-drawn quirky character in the children's editions, but when it crosses over into the adult graphic novels, it can be a smelly foot with long nails that haven't been cut in ages,

The characters need to be:
* unique, distinct
* strong
* immediately identifiable
* able to stand out/up in their own right

Technology

Incorporate an artfully-drawn QR code in sketches, which takes the reader outside of the book.
