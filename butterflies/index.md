# How butterflies got their colour

<pre>
The Butterflies of Bygone Times
Were bleak, drab and quite dreary
Were they ultra-violet, or infra-red?
No, invisible! That was the theory!

It certainly was high time to ponder.
The Elderflies had a muse.
Ah! The eldest pointed yonder.
“What on earth is that colourful ooze?”

At once all Butterflies dipped in ink
and took on pretty hues.
Standard blue made Butterflue
and pink gave Butterflink.

The University of Lemon Canary
welcomed Butterfellows
where they made butter cookies, banana-custard-cream
and all other things yellow.

Now, Orange was the hardest name.
What to call such a thing?
Buttercarrot? Butterpeach?
Or, Buttertangerine?

Enveloped in black were the Butterflacks
(black bats and shadows)
fluttering slivers of burnt-out wood.
Swiftly came gliding the Butterflights,
their white, bright blinding light piercing through.

The Butterfreens were mossy green
Like olives, ferns and tall bamboo
But the only ones left unseen
was the Butter-see-through

So, next time you have butter on your toast;
See something small
                  glide, fly and flutter
Think about the colour you like the most
and remember the tale of how butterflies got their colour.
